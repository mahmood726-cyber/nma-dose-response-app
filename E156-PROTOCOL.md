## `[122]` NMA Dose-Response Studio: Browser-Based Network Meta-Analysis with Dose-Response Modeling

**Type:** methods  |  ESTIMAND: Pooled treatment effect with dose-response curve  
**Data:** R metafor and netmeta validation benchmarks

### 156-word body

Can network meta-analysis be combined with dose-response modeling in a single browser environment accessible to clinical researchers? NMA Dose-Response Studio v2.0.1 is a browser application implementing network meta-analysis with five heterogeneity estimators, six dose-response model families including Emax and fractional polynomials, Bayesian model averaging, and diagnostic accuracy synthesis, validated with 79 of 79 tests passing against R metafor. The platform provides SUCRA and P-score ranking, node-splitting inconsistency tests, eight publication bias methods, and data quality checks including GRIME and SPRITE with keyboard accessibility. All heterogeneity estimates, pooled effects, and ranking probabilities matched reference R packages within pre-specified tolerances across the validation suite. Bootstrap analyses using reproducible seeds with up to 10,000 iterations confirmed stable treatment rankings and consistent confidence intervals. These results demonstrate that complex multi-method evidence synthesis can operate reliably within browser computation constraints. However, the limitation of client-side Gaussian process fitting means very large treatment networks may exhaust available memory before convergence is achieved.

Data availability: No patient-level data used. Analysis derived exclusively
  from publicly available aggregate records. All source identifiers are in
  the protocol document linked above.

Ethics: Not required. Study uses only publicly available aggregate data; no
  human participants; no patient-identifiable information; no individual-
  participant data. No institutional review board approval sought or required
  under standard research-ethics guidelines for secondary methodological
  research on published literature.

Funding: None.

Competing interests: MA serves on the editorial board of Synthēsis (the
  target journal); MA had no role in editorial decisions on this
  manuscript, which was handled by an independent editor of the journal.

AI disclosure: Computational tooling (including AI-assisted coding via
  Claude Code [Anthropic]) was used to develop analysis scripts and assist
  with data extraction. The final manuscript was human-written, reviewed,
  and approved by the author; the submitted text is not AI-generated. All
  quantitative claims were verified against source data; cross-validation
  was performed where applicable. The author retains full responsibility for
  the final content.

Preprint: Not preprinted.

Reporting checklist: PRISMA 2020 (methods-paper variant — reports on review corpus).

Target journal: ◆ Synthēsis (https://www.synthesis-medicine.org/index.php/journal)
  Section: Methods Note — submit the 156-word E156 body verbatim as the main text.
  The journal caps main text at ≤400 words; E156's 156-word, 7-sentence
  contract sits well inside that ceiling. Do NOT pad to 400 — the
  micro-paper length is the point of the format.
